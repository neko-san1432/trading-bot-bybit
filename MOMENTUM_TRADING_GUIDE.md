# üöÄ High Momentum Trading Guide - $1.7 to $200

## Overview
This guide is specifically designed for trading highly volatile, bullish coins (50-100% gains in 24h) with a small balance. The strategy focuses on momentum continuation and rapid profit-taking.

## üéØ Your Specific Requirements
- **Starting Balance**: $1.7
- **Target Balance**: $200+ 
- **Trading Style**: High momentum, high volatility
- **Coin Selection**: 50-100% gainers in past 24h
- **Risk Level**: Very High (aggressive)

## üîß Position Sizing Issue Fix

### The Problem
You're getting "insufficient balance" errors even with $8.32 when required margin is $6.67. This happens because:

1. **Leverage Calculation**: With 100x leverage, you need margin = position_value / leverage
2. **Position Value**: Your position value is too large for your balance
3. **Risk Management**: The system is trying to risk too much per trade

### The Solution
```bash
# Run the position calculator to debug
python position_calculator.py
```

This will show you exactly why trades fail and suggest fixes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage
```bash
# Start with default settings ($1.7 -> $200)
python run_momentum_bot.py

# Custom balance and target
python run_momentum_bot.py --balance 1.7 --target 200

# Safer settings for small balance
python run_momentum_bot.py --leverage 50 --risk 0.10 --max-positions 1
```

### 2. Position Size Calculator
```bash
# Debug position sizing issues
python run_momentum_bot.py --calculator
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimal Settings for $1.7 Balance

### Recommended Configuration
```python
# For $1.7 starting balance
account_balance = 1.7
leverage = 50x          # Instead of 100x
risk_per_trade = 10%    # Instead of 20%
max_positions = 1       # Only 1 position
stop_distance = 3%      # Instead of 2%
max_position_value = $10 # Cap position size
```

### Why These Settings?
- **50x Leverage**: Reduces margin requirements by half
- **10% Risk**: More conservative for small balance
- **1 Position**: Focus all capital on best opportunity
- **3% Stops**: Wider stops = smaller position sizes needed
- **$10 Cap**: Prevents oversized positions

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start Small**: Test with $5-10 first
2. **Paper Trade**: Test strategy without real money
3. **Monitor Closely**: Watch every trade
4. **Set Limits**: Never risk more than you can lose
5. **Be Ready to Stop**: If losses mount, stop immediately

## üí° Success Tips

### 1. Market Timing
- Trade during high volatility periods
- Focus on major news events
- Avoid low-volume periods
- Trade during US/EU overlap

### 2. Coin Selection
- Prioritize high-volume coins
- Avoid coins with low liquidity
- Check for recent news/catalysts
- Monitor social sentiment

### 3. Risk Management
- Never risk more than 10% per trade

- Don't add to losing positions

### 4. Psychology

### "Insufficient Balance" Error
```bash
# Run calculator to debug

```

### Common Solutions
1. **Reduce Leverage**: Use 25x instead of 50x
2. **Wider Stops**: Use 5% stops instead of 3%
3. **Smaller Risk**: Use 5% risk instead of 10%
4. **Higher Prices**: Trade BTC/ETH instead of low-price coins
